# cses-problemset-solutions
Hi there! I am Aayush 
This repository consists of topicwise solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/)

Features:
1- Well structured solutions organized by topic
2- Clean and readable C++ Code
3- Focus on different problem solving approaches and DSA concepts

Whether you're someone who enjoys competitive programming and problem solving(like me) and wants to build their basics, or if youre more focused on improving your DSA concepts and preparing for technical interviews, this is definitely for you and I'm sure you will find this helpful!

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: I would suggest not to directly jump to the codes and read the solutions, but to first diligently try out and think on the problem for atleast 15-20 mins,and if nothing works then come and see the solutions, trust me you will understand much better this way :)) 

Feel free to reach out to me for:-
1- Suggestions
2- Improvements
3- Discuss solutions/problem solving approaches

I'm still learning and building my skills, so I'm more than welcome to hear from you and discuss.

**Happy coding!** ðŸ˜Š
